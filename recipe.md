Place the ramekins on a baking sheet. Bake on the middle rack of the oven for 11-13 minutes or until edges are set but center is still soft; do not over-bake.

Remove from the oven and let sit for 2 minutes.

Run a small knife around the edges to loosen and invert onto dessert plates or you can serve each molten lava cake still in the cup.
